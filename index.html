  <p>
    I am trained in the field of <strong>Programming Languages</strong> and are looking for impact in other fields,
    especially in <strong>CS Education</strong>. My other academic background also includes Bioinformatics, in which I had
    a Bachelor's degree, and (Bio)statistics, in which I have been constantly taking courses.
    I also know a little about Cognitive Science, Linguistics, and Human-Computer Interaction by taking courses and
    talking to people in those areas.

  <p>
    Currently, I am a 3rd-year doctoral student at <a href="https://www.brown.edu/">Brown University</a>,
    advised by <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/">Shriram Krishnamurthi</a>.
    Here I did some works on <a href="https://blog.brownplt.org/2021/11/21/b2t2.html">type system × tabular data</a> and
    some works on <a href="https://blog.brownplt.org/2022/06/28/static-python.html">gradual typing × Python</a>.
    Now I am working on CSEd Research. More specifically,
    I focus on <em><a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2022/smol.html">teaching the semantics of
    programming languages</a></em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was a MS CS student at <a href="https://www.indiana.edu/">Indiana
      University</a>. I worked on <a href="https://prl.ccs.neu.edu/gtp/about.html">Gradual
      Typing</a> and relational programming. <a

  <p>
    I was a Bioinformatics undergrad at <a href="https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>,
    advised by <a href="https://cgm.sjtu.edu.cn/index/index.php">Chaochun Wei</a>.

  <h2>On-going projects</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>SMoL Tutor</strong>: an intelligent tutoring system for teaching the semantics of programming languages
    (i.e.,
    how programming languages "work").
    This systems is <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2022/smol.html">being used in course CSCI1730 at Brown
      University</a>.
    Contact me or Shriram to access the code of the system.

    <strong>Stacker (<a href="https://github.com/LuKC1024/stacker">available on GitHub</a>)</strong>:
    a notional machine (a presentation of how computer programs execute). This
    notional machine is designed help studensts form good mental models of scope,
    mutable variables, mutable data structures, and first-class functions.
    It is implemented as a GUI software application running on top of Racket.

  <h2>Opinions</h2>
  <p>The fundamental questions about education research are what to teach
  (which can be answered by envisioning the future society) and how to teach
  (which can only be answered by trying various teaching approaches, although
  heuristics can be drawn from several fields).
