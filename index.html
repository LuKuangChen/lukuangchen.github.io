    I am a 4-th year PhD candidate at Brown University. Advised by <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/">Shriram Krishnamurthi</a>,
    I am doing research on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_education">Computing Education</a>,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods">Formal Methods</a>, and their intersection.
    Please check my <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6502-9275">ORCID page</a> for publications and my other academic backgrounds.

  <p>I am looking for an industrial job related to any combination of programming languages, education, and statistics. I will be available for work starting from <u>mid 2025</u>.</p>
  <p>
    I was a MS CS student at <a href="https://www.indiana.edu/">Indiana
      University</a>. I worked on <a href="https://prl.ccs.neu.edu/gtp/about.html">Gradual
      Typing</a> and relational programming. <a href="https://wphomes.soic.indiana.edu/jsiek/">Jeremy
      Siek</a> advised <a href="Downloads/thesis-of-KuangChen.pdf">my master's thesis</a>.

  <p>
    I was a Bioinformatics undergrad at <a href="https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>,
    advised by <a href="https://cgm.sjtu.edu.cn/index/index.php">Chaochun Wei</a>.

  <h2>On-going projects</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://smol-tutor.xyz/">SMoL Tutor</a>: an intelligent tutoring system for teaching the semantics of programming languages
    (i.e., how programming languages "work").
    This system has been used at Brown and a few other institutions around the world.
    Please contact me or Shriram to get a copy of the system.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://smol-tutor.xyz/stacker/">Stacker</a>:
    a notional machine (a presentation of how computer programs execute). This
    notional machine is designed to help students form good mental models of scope,
    mutable variables, mutable data structures, and first-class functions.
    It is implemented as a GUI software application running on top of Racket.

  <h2>Opinions</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <q>
      Let us ask, Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number?
      No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence?
      No. Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.
    </q>
    <br />
    &mdash; David Hume, <cite>An inquiry concerning human understanding</cite>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The fundamental questions about education research are what to teach
    (which can be answered by envisioning the future society) and how to teach
    (which can only be answered by trying various teaching approaches, although
    heuristics can be drawn from several fields).

    <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/dan-scheme/">Scheme</a> and <a
      href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Agda</a>
    are my favorite programming languages.
    (But honestly, bad languages with good IDEs are generally <em>way</em> better than good languages with bad IDEs.)

    Pyret <a href="https://www.pyret.org/docs/latest/equality.html">does a great job</a> in defining the notions of
    equality.
